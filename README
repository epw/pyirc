First, make the IRC object. It takes 4 or 5 arguments. Host, port,
nickname, real name, and an optional channel to join.

In a loop, run the IRC object's main() method, and save the return
value. The return value is a tuple containing each line's sender,
target, if it was an action, and the message body.

The bot's three main methods are join(), which takes the name of a
channel to join, say(), which takes a name where to send the message
and the message itself, and action(), which is the same.
